This project has been built in collaboration with 
Vishesh Kumar Singh  (https://www.github.com/visheshks04)

## Setup:

Install cv2, mediapipe and numpy:

Use pip(for python2) or pip3(for python3) to install both the libraries

Commands:<br>
For open-cv: ```pip3 install opencv-python```<br>
For mediapipe: ```pip3 install mediapipe```<br>
For numpy: ```pip3 install numpy```<br>

### For Windows systems, it needs nircmd installed additionally. <br>

Download this zip: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.zip and then copy the nircmd.exe file to C:\\Windows:
